## Test Coverage Targets

| Component | Target | Critical Path |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| Custom modules | 80% | 95% |

## Test Types Priority

**Priority 1** (Must have):
- Unit tests for all custom modules
- Integration tests for critical paths
- Smoke tests for deployment
- Basic performance tests

**Priority 2** (Should have):
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Load testing
- Security testing
- Regression test suite

**Priority 3** (Nice to have):
- Property-based tests
- Chaos engineering tests
- Long-running soak tests
- Comprehensive mocking infrastructure

## Common Testing Mistakes

❌ **No mocking**: Tests hit real LM APIs (slow, expensive)
❌ **No assertions**: Tests pass but don't verify behavior
❌ **Testing implementation**: Tests break on refactoring
❌ **Flaky tests**: Tests pass/fail randomly
❌ **Slow tests**: Unit tests take >1 minute
❌ **No test data**: Hard to reproduce bugs
❌ **Skipping integration tests**: Unit tests pass but system broken
❌ **No performance tests**: Production performance unknown
❌ **No regression tests**: Old bugs resurface
❌ **Test debt**: Tests not maintained, become obsolete
