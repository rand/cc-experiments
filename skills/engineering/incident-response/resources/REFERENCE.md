## Incident Response Overview

### What is Incident Response?

Incident response is a structured approach to managing service disruptions, outages, and degradations. It encompasses:
- **Detection**: Identifying issues through monitoring and alerts
- **Response**: Coordinated action to mitigate impact
- **Resolution**: Restoring service to normal operation
- **Learning**: Post-incident analysis and improvement

### Why Incident Response Matters

**Business Impact**:
- Revenue loss from downtime ($5,600/min for enterprise apps)
- Customer trust and retention
- SLA compliance and penalties
- Brand reputation

**Engineering Benefits**:
- Faster recovery times (MTTR)
- Reduced blast radius
- Knowledge sharing
- System resilience improvements

**Cultural Impact**:
- Blameless culture development
- Cross-team collaboration
- Operational excellence mindset
- Continuous improvement

### Key Principles

1. **Customer First**: Prioritize service restoration over root cause analysis
2. **Blameless Culture**: Focus on systems, not individuals
3. **Clear Communication**: Keep stakeholders informed
4. **Document Everything**: Create audit trail and learning material
5. **Learn and Improve**: Every incident is a learning opportunity

### Incident Response vs. Problem Management

| Aspect | Incident Response | Problem Management |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| Goal | Restore service quickly | Prevent recurrence |
| Timeline | Minutes to hours | Days to weeks |
| Focus | Mitigation | Root cause |
| Output | Service restored | Permanent fix |
| Process | Reactive | Proactive |

## Incident Lifecycle

### Lifecycle Stages

```
Detection → Response → Mitigation → Resolution → Postmortem
    ↓          ↓           ↓            ↓            ↓
  Alert    Assemble   Implement    Verify      Document
            Team       Fix          Normal      Lessons
```

### Stage 1: Detection

**Objectives**:
- Identify issues before customers report them
- Minimize time to detection (MTTD)
- Provide actionable alert context

**Detection Methods**:
```
Automated Monitoring
├─ Synthetic checks (uptime, API tests)
├─ Error rate thresholds
├─ Latency degradation
├─ Resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, disk)
└─ Business metric anomalies

Manual Detection
├─ Customer reports
├─ Support tickets
├─ Social media mentions
└─ Partner notifications
```

**Alert Quality**:
- **High signal-to-noise**: Minimize false positives
- **Actionable**: Include context and next steps
- **Prioritized**: Clear severity levels
- **Routable**: Correct team/person

**Example Detection Workflow**:
```python
# Monitoring system detects anomaly
if error_rate > threshold:
    severity = classify_severity(error_rate, impact)
    context = gather_context(service, region, time_window)

    alert = create_alert(
        severity=severity,
        title=f"High error rate in {service}",
        description=f"{error_rate}% errors in last 5min",
        context=context,
        runbook_url=get_runbook_url(service, "high_error_rate")
    )

    route_alert(alert, escalation_policy)
```

### Stage 2: Response

**Objectives**:
- Acknowledge incident quickly
- Assemble appropriate team
- Establish command structure
- Begin assessment

**Initial Response Checklist**:
- [ ] Acknowledge alert (stop paging)
- [ ] Assess severity and impact
- [ ] Create incident ticket/page
- [ ] Notify stakeholders
- [ ] Assign incident commander
- [ ] Open communication channel (Slack, war room)
- [ ] Start incident timeline

**Response Time Targets**:
| Severity | Acknowledgment | Initial Response | Time to Engage IC |
|----------|---------------|------------------|-------------------|
| SEV-1    | 5 minutes     | 10 minutes      | Immediate        |
| SEV-2    | 15 minutes    | 30 minutes      | 30 minutes       |
| SEV-3    | 30 minutes    | 1 hour          | 2 hours          |
| SEV-4    | 2 hours       | 4 hours         | Next business day |

**Incident Commander Selection**:
```
SEV-1: Senior engineer + on-call manager
SEV-2: On-call lead or experienced engineer
SEV-3: On-call engineer
SEV-4: Ticket owner
```

### Stage 3: Mitigation

**Objectives**:
- Reduce customer impact as quickly as possible
- Implement workarounds if full fix unavailable
- Maintain service stability

**Mitigation Strategies**:
```
Immediate Actions (< 15 minutes)
├─ Rollback recent deployment
├─ Disable problematic feature flag
├─ Scale resources (CPU, replicas)
├─ Route traffic away from failing region
├─ Restart failing services
└─ Enable maintenance mode

Short-term Fixes (15 min - 2 hours)
├─ Apply hotfix patch
├─ Increase resource limits
├─ Implement rate limiting
├─ Switch to backup system
└─ Manual data correction

Temporary Workarounds
├─ Graceful degradation
├─ Queue requests for later
├─ Return cached data
└─ Display maintenance message
```

**Rollback Decision Tree**:
```
Recent deployment? YES → Was it tested? NO → ROLLBACK
                                       YES → High confidence in deployment?
                                              NO → ROLLBACK
                                              YES → Is fix faster than rollback?
                                                     YES → Implement fix
                                                     NO → ROLLBACK
```

**Example Mitigation Code**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Emergency mitigation script

SEVERITY=$1
SERVICE=$2

case $SEVERITY in
  SEV-1)
    # Immediate rollback
    kubectl rollout undo deployment/$SERVICE
    # Disable feature flag
    curl -X POST "$FEATURE_FLAG_API/disable" -d "{\"flag\":\"$NEW_FEATURE\"}"
    # Scale up
    kubectl scale deployment/$SERVICE --replicas=10
    ;;
  SEV-2)
    # Route traffic to healthy region
    aws route53 change-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id $ZONE \
      --change-batch file://failover-to-us-west.json
    ;;
esac
```

### Stage 4: Resolution

**Objectives**:
- Restore full service functionality
- Verify systems are healthy
- Confirm customer impact resolved
- Document actions taken

**Resolution Criteria**:
```

### Stage 5: Postmortem

**Objectives**:
- Document what happened
- Identify root causes
- Define action items to prevent recurrence
- Share learnings across organization

**Postmortem Timeline**:
```
Resolution + 24 hours: Draft postmortem
Resolution + 72 hours: Review meeting
Resolution + 1 week:   Action items assigned
Resolution + 1 month:  Follow-up on completion
```

**Postmortem Components** (detailed in section 10):
- Timeline of events
- Impact assessment
- Root cause analysis
- What went well
- What went poorly
- Action items with owners

### Auto-Classification Rules

```python
def classify_incident_severity(metrics: dict) -> str:
    """
    Auto-classify incident severity based on metrics.
    """
    # Critical indicators
    if (metrics['error_rate'] > 50 or
        metrics['users_affected_pct'] > 50 or
        metrics['revenue_impact_per_hour'] > 10000 or
        metrics['sla_breach'] == True):
        return 'SEV-1'

    # High severity indicators
    if (metrics['error_rate'] > 10 or
        metrics['users_affected_pct'] > 10 or
        metrics['latency_p95'] > metrics['baseline_p95'] * 3 or
        metrics['revenue_impact_per_hour'] > 1000):
        return 'SEV-2'

    # Medium severity indicators
    if (metrics['error_rate'] > 1 or
        metrics['users_affected_pct'] > 1 or
        metrics['partial_feature_outage'] == True):
        return 'SEV-3'

    # Default to low severity
    return 'SEV-4'
```

### Severity Escalation

**When to Escalate**:
- Impact worse than initially assessed
- Resolution taking longer than expected
- Additional services affected
- Customer complaints increasing
- Media/social media attention

**De-escalation Criteria**:
- Impact reduced (e.g., SEV-1 → SEV-2)
- Mitigation successful
- User count affected decreased
- Workaround deployed

## Incident Commander Role

### Incident Commander (IC) Responsibilities

**Primary Duties**:
1. **Coordinate Response**: Direct technical responders
2. **Make Decisions**: Final call on mitigation strategies
3. **Manage Communication**: Ensure stakeholders informed
4. **Maintain Timeline**: Document key events
5. **Drive Resolution**: Keep team focused on restoration
6. **Declare Resolved**: Determine when incident is over

**IC is NOT**:
- The person who fixes the technical issue
- The person who writes all updates
- Responsible for finding root cause (during incident)
- Working on multiple tasks simultaneously

### IC Playbook

**Initial Actions (First 5 Minutes)**:
```bash
# 1. Join war room / communication channel
# 2. Announce IC role
"I'm taking IC for this incident. Current status?"

# 3. Quick assessment
- What's broken?
- Who's affected?
- What's been tried?
- What resources do we need?

# 4. Assign roles
- Technical lead (hands-on keyboard)
- Communications lead (stakeholder updates)
- Scribe (timeline documentation)

# 5. Set first checkpoint
"Let's reconvene in 15 minutes with status update"
```

**During Incident**:
```
Every 15-30 minutes:
├─ Status check with technical team
├─ Decision point: continue current path or pivot?
├─ Update stakeholders
├─ Document timeline events
└─ Adjust resource allocation

Key Questions:
├─ "What have we tried?"
├─ "What are we trying now?"
├─ "What's our rollback plan?"
├─ "Do we need more people?"
└─ "Are customers still impacted?"
```

**Resolution Phase**:
- Verify all resolution criteria met
- Get confirmation from technical team
- Announce resolution in war room
- Send final stakeholder update
- Schedule postmortem
- Hand off follow-up actions
- Close incident ticket

### IC Decision Framework

**Decision Types**:

1. **Rollback Decisions**:
```
Confidence in fix? LOW → ROLLBACK
Time to fix?      >30min → ROLLBACK
Customer impact?  GROWING → ROLLBACK
Risk of fix?      HIGH → ROLLBACK
```

2. **Escalation Decisions**:
```
Need expertise not on call? → Page specialist
Need management decision? → Escalate to on-call manager
Need vendor support? → Open critical support ticket
Need more hands? → Page additional responders
```

3. **Communication Decisions**:
```
SEV-1: Update every 30 minutes minimum
SEV-2: Update every hour
SEV-3: Update every 2-4 hours
SEV-4: Update at start and resolution
```

### IC Handoff Protocol

**When to Hand Off**:
- IC needs to go offline (exhaustion, personal reasons)
- Incident duration exceeds 4-6 hours
- Timezone shift requires local IC
- IC becomes technical responder

**Handoff Checklist**:
```markdown
## IC Handoff Template

### Internal Communication (War Room)

**War Room Best Practices**:
```
Channel Purpose: Incident coordination only
├─ No side conversations
├─ Key decisions documented
├─ Action items tracked
└─ Timeline maintained

Communication Flow:
├─ IC: Overall coordination
├─ Tech Lead: Technical updates
├─ Scribe: Timeline documentation
└─ Comms Lead: External updates

Update Format:
[TIME] [PERSON] Action/Decision/Status
Example:
[14:23] @alice Rolled back deployment v2.5.3
[14:25] @bob Error rate decreased to 2%
[14:27] @ic Decision: Monitor for 10 min before resolving
```

**War Room Roles**:
1. **Incident Commander**: Leads, makes decisions
2. **Technical Lead**: Hands on keyboard, executes fixes
3. **Subject Matter Experts**: Provide domain expertise
4. **Communications Lead**: Manages external updates
5. **Scribe**: Documents timeline and decisions
6. **Observers**: Stakeholders who need visibility (muted)

### Customer-Facing Communication

```
Customer Experience Layer (Top)
├─ Synthetic monitoring (external checks)
├─ Real user monitoring (RUM)
└─ Business metrics (conversions, transactions)

Application Layer
├─ Error rates and types
├─ Request latency (p50, p95, p99)
├─ Request volume
└─ Dependency health

```

### Alert Design Principles

**The Four Golden Signals** (Google SRE):
1. **Latency**: Time to service requests
2. **Traffic**: Demand on system
3. **Errors**: Rate of failed requests
4. **Saturation**: Resource utilization

**Alert Quality Criteria**:
```python
class Alert:
    """
    Well-designed alert structure.
    """
    title: str              # Clear, specific problem
    severity: str           # SEV-1, SEV-2, SEV-3, SEV-4
    description: str        # What's wrong, what's affected
    impact: str             # User-facing impact
    runbook_url: str        # Link to response procedures
    dashboard_url: str      # Relevant metrics dashboard
    context: dict           # Service, region, environment
    threshold: float        # What triggered alert
    current_value: float    # Current metric value
    duration: int           # How long issue persists

def is_good_alert(alert: Alert) -> bool:
    """
    Validate alert quality.
    """
    checks = [
        alert.title is not "ALERT",  # Specific title
        alert.runbook_url is not None,  # Actionable
        alert.current_value > alert.threshold,  # Real issue
        alert.context['service'] in KNOWN_SERVICES,  # Routable
    ]
    return all(checks)
```

### Alert Configuration Examples

**Error Rate Alert**:
```yaml
# Prometheus AlertManager
groups:
  - name: api_errors
    interval: 1m
    rules:
      - alert: HighErrorRate
        expr: |

            sum(rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m]))
            /
            sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m]))
          ) > 0.05
        for: 5m
        labels:

  expr: |
    histogram_quantile(0.95,
      sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) by (le, service)
    ) > 1.0
  for: 10m
  labels:
    severity: SEV-3
    service: "{{ $labels.service }}"
  annotations:

```

### Alert Fatigue Prevention

**Strategies**:
1. **Alert Tuning**: Adjust thresholds to reduce false positives
2. **Alert Grouping**: Combine related alerts
3. **Alert Dependencies**: Suppress downstream alerts
4. **Time-based Filtering**: Different thresholds for peak vs. off-peak
5. **Anomaly Detection**: ML-based dynamic thresholds

**Alert Deduplication**:
```python
def should_fire_alert(alert: Alert, recent_alerts: List[Alert]) -> bool:
    """
    Prevent alert fatigue through deduplication.
    """
    # Don't fire same alert within cooldown period
    COOLDOWN_MINUTES = 30

    similar_recent = [
        a for a in recent_alerts
        if a.title == alert.title and
           (alert.timestamp - a.timestamp).minutes < COOLDOWN_MINUTES
    ]

    if similar_recent:
        return False

    # Don't fire downstream alerts if root cause alert exists
    ROOT_CAUSES = {
        'database_down': ['high_latency', 'high_error_rate'],
        'network_partition': ['service_unreachable', 'health_check_fail']
    }

    for root_cause, downstream in ROOT_CAUSES.items():
        if alert.title in downstream:
            root_alert_active = any(
                a.title == root_cause and a.status == 'firing'
                for a in recent_alerts
            )
            if root_alert_active:
                return False  # Suppress downstream alert

    return True
```

## Response and Mitigation

### Mitigation Playbook

**Immediate Actions (< 5 minutes)**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Emergency response toolkit

# 1. Check recent deployments
echo "Recent deployments (last 2 hours):"
kubectl rollout history deployment/$SERVICE | tail -5

# 2. Check current health
echo "Current pod status:"
kubectl get pods -l app=$SERVICE

# 3. Check error rates
echo "Recent errors:"
kubectl logs -l app=$SERVICE --since=30m | grep ERROR | tail -20

# 4. Quick rollback if needed
read -p "Rollback to previous version? (y/n) " -n 1 -r
if [[ $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
    kubectl rollout undo deployment/$SERVICE
    echo "Rollback initiated"
fi
```

### Mitigation Strategies by Root Cause

**1. Deployment Issues**:
```yaml
Problem: Recent deployment caused errors

Mitigation Priority:
1. Rollback deployment (fastest)
2. Disable feature flag (if flagged)
3. Hotfix deployment (if fix is trivial)
4. Route traffic away (if multi-region)

Commands:
  rollback: kubectl rollout undo deployment/$SERVICE
  status: kubectl rollout status deployment/$SERVICE
  feature_flag: curl -X POST $FLAG_API/disable -d '{"flag":"new_feature"}'
```

**2. Resource Exhaustion**:
```yaml
Problem: Service out of CPU/memory/connections

Mitigation Priority:
1. Scale up replicas (immediate relief)
2. Increase resource limits
3. Restart pods to clear memory leaks
4. Identify and kill resource-intensive requests

Commands:
  scale: kubectl scale deployment/$SERVICE --replicas=10
  restart: kubectl rollout restart deployment/$SERVICE
  resources: kubectl set resources deployment/$SERVICE --limits=memory=4Gi
```

**3. Dependency Failures**:
```yaml
Problem: External service/database unavailable

Mitigation Priority:
1. Enable graceful degradation
2. Serve from cache
3. Failover to backup system
4. Queue requests for later

Code Example:
  try:
      result = external_api.call()
  except TimeoutError:
      # Graceful degradation
      result = cache.get(key, default=FALLBACK_DATA)
      metrics.increment('degraded_mode')
```

**4. Database Issues**:
```yaml
Problem: Database slow/unavailable

Mitigation Priority:
1. Kill long-running queries
2. Failover to read replica
3. Enable read-only mode
4. Scale database resources

Commands:
  # Kill slow queries
  SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid)
  FROM pg_stat_activity
  WHERE state = 'active' AND query_start < NOW() - INTERVAL '5 minutes';

  # Failover to replica
  aws rds failover-db-cluster --db-cluster-identifier $CLUSTER
```

**5. Traffic Spikes**:
```yaml
Problem: Unexpected traffic overwhelming system

Mitigation Priority:
1. Enable rate limiting
2. Scale up services
3. Enable CDN caching
4. Shed non-critical traffic

Rate Limiting Example:
  # Nginx rate limiting
  limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=api:10m rate=10r/s;
  limit_req zone=api burst=20 nodelay;
```

### Runbook Template

```markdown
# Runbook: High Error Rate in API Service

## Symptoms
- Error rate > 5% in /api/v1/* endpoints
- Alert: "HighErrorRate" firing
- Users reporting failures

## Impact
- API requests failing
- Customer-facing features degraded
- Potential data loss if errors during writes

## Diagnosis

### Step 1: Check Recent Changes
```bash
# Check deployments
kubectl rollout history deployment/api-service

# Check feature flags
curl $FLAG_API/api-service/flags
```

### Step 2: Identify Error Types
```bash
# Recent errors
kubectl logs -l app=api-service --since=30m | grep ERROR

# Error breakdown
curl $METRICS_API/query?q=http_errors_by_code
```

### Step 3: Check Dependencies
```bash
# Database connectivity
pg_isready -h $DB_HOST

# Redis connectivity
redis-cli -h $REDIS_HOST ping

# External APIs
curl -I $EXTERNAL_API/health
```

## Mitigation

### Quick Win: Rollback Recent Deployment
```bash
kubectl rollout undo deployment/api-service
kubectl rollout status deployment/api-service
# Wait 5 minutes and verify error rate
```

### If Rollback Doesn't Help: Check Resources
```bash
# Scale up
kubectl scale deployment/api-service --replicas=10

# Check resource usage
kubectl top pods -l app=api-service
```

### If Database Issue: Failover
```bash
# Check replication lag
SELECT now() - pg_last_xact_replay_timestamp() AS lag;

# If needed, failover
aws rds failover-db-cluster --db-cluster-identifier prod-cluster
```

## Escalation
- If error rate > 20%: Page database team
- If duration > 30 min: Page engineering manager
- If customer data at risk: Page security team

## Prevention
- Add integration tests for this scenario
- Improve monitoring for early detection
- Document known failure modes
- Review deployment process
```

## War Rooms and Coordination

### War Room Setup

**When to Create War Room**:
- SEV-1 incidents (always)
- SEV-2 incidents expected to last > 1 hour
- Multi-team coordination needed
- Complex incidents requiring expertise from multiple domains

**War Room Channels**:
```
Primary Channel: Slack #incident-YYYYMMDD-description
├─ All incident communication
├─ Timeline documentation
├─ Decision tracking
└─ Status updates

Backup Channel: Zoom/Google Meet
├─ Voice communication for critical coordination
├─ Screen sharing for debugging
└─ Recorded for postmortem review

Status Channel: #incidents (public)
├─ High-level status for visibility
├─ Links to primary war room
└─ No detailed technical discussion
```

### War Room Best Practices

**Channel Setup**:
```bash
# Create incident channel
slack channel create "#incident-20251027-api-errors"

# Set topic
slack channel topic \
  "#incident-20251027-api-errors" \
  "SEV-1: High error rates in API | IC: @alice | Started: 14:30 UTC"

# Invite key people
slack channel invite "#incident-20251027-api-errors" \
  @alice @bob @charlie @on-call-team

# Pin important links
slack pin "Incident ticket: https://jira.example.com/INCIDENT-123"
slack pin "Dashboard: https://grafana.example.com/d/api-overview"
slack pin "Runbook: https://runbooks.example.com/api/high-error-rate"
```

**Communication Structure**:
```
Role-Based Threading:
├─ IC: Announces decisions, coordinates
├─ Tech Lead: Technical updates
├─ Comms: External updates
├─ Scribe: Timeline documentation
└─ SMEs: Answer specific questions

Update Format:
[14:30] [IC] Incident declared SEV-1. @bob taking tech lead.
[14:32] [Tech] Error rate at 35%. Checking recent deployments.
[14:35] [Tech] Found deployment v2.1.5 at 14:15. Correlates with spike.
[14:37] [IC] Decision: Rolling back to v2.1.4
[14:38] [Tech] Rollback initiated.
[14:42] [Tech] Rollback complete. Error rate decreasing.
[14:45] [Comms] Customer update sent.
[14:50] [Tech] Error rate back to baseline (0.5%).
[14:52] [IC] Monitoring for 15 minutes before declaring resolved.
```

### Coordination Patterns

**Multi-Team Coordination**:
```
Incident affects multiple services across teams

Structure:
├─ Overall IC (senior, cross-functional)
├─ Service-specific tech leads
│   ├─ API Team lead
│   ├─ Database Team lead
│   └─ Frontend Team lead
├─ Single comms lead
└─ Single scribe

Communication Flow:
[IC] → Overall coordination, final decisions
  ↓
[Service Leads] → Technical work in their domain
  ↓
[IC] ← Status reports every 15 min
```

**Shift Handoffs**:
```markdown
## War Room Handoff (6-hour mark)

**From**: Alice (IC, 08:00-14:00 UTC)
**To**: Bob (IC, 14:00-20:00 UTC)

### Current State
- SEV-1 ongoing since 08:30 UTC (5.5 hours)
- Intermittent errors in payment processing
- ~15% of transactions failing
- Current error rate: 12% (down from peak 25%)

### Mitigation Status
- ✅ Rolled back deployment
- ✅ Scaled payment service 3x → 10x
- ⏳ Database team investigating slow queries
- ⏳ Monitoring for stability

### People On Call
- Tech Lead: Charlie (payment service expert)
- Database: Diana (investigating query performance)
- Comms: Eve (sending hourly updates)
- Scribe: Frank (maintaining timeline)

### Pending Decisions
- If error rate not below 5% by 15:00, consider enabling maintenance mode
- Database team needs go/no-go on query optimization vs. failover

### Next Update Due
- Customer update at 14:30 UTC
- Leadership update at 15:00 UTC

### Important Context
- Payment partner (Stripe) confirmed healthy on their end
- Database replica lag increased to 30 seconds (usually <5s)
- No customer data loss confirmed

### War Room Links
- Slack: #incident-20251027-payments
- Zoom: https://zoom.us/j/12345
- Ticket: INCIDENT-456

### Example Runbooks

**Runbook: Database Connection Pool Exhausted**:
```markdown
# Database Connection Pool Exhausted

## Symptoms
- Alert: "DatabaseConnectionPoolHigh" firing
- Application logs show "Cannot acquire connection from pool"
- Increased latency on database queries (p95 > 2s)
- Error rate elevated in services using database

## Impact
- API requests timing out
- User login failures
- Data writes delayed or failing

## Diagnosis

### Step 1: Verify Pool Exhaustion
```sql
-- Check active connections
SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active';

-- Check connection pool stats (from app metrics)
curl http://localhost:9090/metrics | grep connection_pool
```

### Step 2: Identify Long-Running Queries
```sql
SELECT pid, now() - query_start AS duration, query
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE state = 'active'
ORDER BY duration DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Step 3: Check for Connection Leaks
```bash
# Check app metrics for connections not returned
kubectl logs -l app=api-service | grep "connection.*not.*closed"
```

## Mitigation

### Option 1: Kill Long-Running Queries (< 2 min)
```sql
-- Kill queries running > 5 minutes
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid)
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE state = 'active'
  AND query_start < now() - interval '5 minutes'
  AND query NOT LIKE '%pg_stat_activity%';
```

### Option 2: Increase Pool Size (< 5 min)
```bash
# Temporary increase
kubectl set env deployment/api-service DB_POOL_SIZE=50

# Monitor improvement
watch 'curl -s http://localhost:9090/metrics | grep connection_pool_active'
```

### Option 3: Restart Application (< 5 min)
```bash
# Forces connection pool recreation
kubectl rollout restart deployment/api-service
```

### Option 4: Scale Database (15-30 min)
```bash
# For RDS
aws rds modify-db-instance \
  --db-instance-identifier prod-db \
  --db-instance-class db.r5.2xlarge \
  --apply-immediately
```

## Escalation
- If pool exhaustion persists > 15 min: Page database team
- If caused by specific query: Page team owning that code
- If database CPU > 80%: Page infrastructure team

## Prevention
- [ ] Add connection pool monitoring alerts (before exhaustion)
- [ ] Implement query timeouts (prevent long-running queries)
- [ ] Review ORM connection handling (fix leaks)
- [ ] Load test to validate pool sizing
- [ ] Add database slow query logging

**Runbook: CDN Cache Misconfiguration**:
```markdown
# CDN Cache Misconfiguration

## Symptoms
- Users seeing stale content
- Alert: "CDNCacheHitRateDropped"
- Customer reports of wrong data displayed
- Cache hit rate < 50% (normal: >90%)

## Impact
- Increased origin server load
- Slower page loads for users
- Potential for serving stale data
- Higher infrastructure costs

## Diagnosis

### Step 1: Check Cache Hit Rate
```bash
# CloudFront
aws cloudfront get-distribution-statistics \
  --distribution-id E1234567890ABC \
  --query 'Statistics.CacheHitRate'

# Fastly
curl -H "Fastly-Key: $API_KEY" \
  https://api.fastly.com/stats/service/$SERVICE_ID
```

### Step 2: Verify Cache Headers
```bash
# Check response headers
curl -I https://www.example.com/api/data

# Look for:
# Cache-Control: max-age=3600
# X-Cache: HIT (should be HIT, not MISS)
# Age: 120 (time in cache)
```

### Step 3: Check Recent Config Changes
```bash
# CloudFront config history
aws cloudfront list-distributions --query \
  'DistributionList.Items[?Id==`E1234567890ABC`].LastModifiedTime'

# Check deployment logs
git log --since="2 hours ago" -- cdn-config/
```

## Mitigation

### Option 1: Invalidate CDN Cache (< 5 min)
```bash
# CloudFront invalidation
aws cloudfront create-invalidation \
  --distribution-id E1234567890ABC \
  --paths "/*"

# Fastly purge
curl -X POST \
  -H "Fastly-Key: $API_KEY" \
  https://api.fastly.com/service/$SERVICE_ID/purge_all
```

### Option 2: Fix Cache Headers (< 10 min)
```python
# Application code - ensure proper headers
@app.route('/api/data')
def get_data():
    response = make_response(data)
    response.headers['Cache-Control'] = 'public, max-age=3600'
    response.headers['ETag'] = compute_etag(data)
    return response
```

### Option 3: Rollback CDN Config (< 15 min)
```bash
# Terraform
cd infrastructure/cdn
git revert HEAD
terraform apply

# Or manual CloudFront
aws cloudfront get-distribution-config \
  --id E1234567890ABC > current-config.json
# Edit to previous state
aws cloudfront update-distribution --if-match $ETAG \
  --distribution-config file://previous-config.json
```

## Escalation
- If cache issue affects payment flows: Immediate escalation to IC
- If origin servers at capacity: Page infrastructure team
- If customer data exposure risk: Page security team

## Prevention
- [ ] Add CDN config tests (validate cache headers)
- [ ] Monitor cache hit rate with alerts
- [ ] Implement gradual rollout for CDN changes
- [ ] Document expected cache behavior per endpoint
- [ ] Add cache header validation in CI/CD

## Postmortems and Retrospectives

### Blameless Postmortem Philosophy

**Core Principles**:
1. **Blameless**: Focus on systems and processes, not individuals
2. **Learning-Focused**: Extract lessons, not assign fault
3. **Action-Oriented**: Define concrete improvements
4. **Transparent**: Share widely for organizational learning
5. **Timely**: Conduct while details are fresh

**What Blameless Means**:
```
✅ DO:
- "The monitoring didn't alert us until 30 minutes in"
- "The deployment process allowed untested code to production"
- "The documentation was outdated"

❌ DON'T:
- "Alice deployed bad code"
- "Bob didn't monitor the deployment"
- "Charlie should have noticed"

Focus: Why did the SYSTEM allow this to happen?
```

### Postmortem Template

```markdown
# Postmortem: [Incident Title]

**Incident ID**: INCIDENT-123
**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Duration**: 2 hours 15 minutes (14:30-16:45 UTC)
**Severity**: SEV-1
**Incident Commander**: Alice Smith

## Executive Summary

In 2-3 sentences, describe what happened, the impact, and the resolution.

Example:
> On October 27, 2025, our API service experienced elevated error rates (35% peak)
> for 2 hours and 15 minutes, affecting approximately 150,000 users. The issue was
> caused by a database connection pool exhaustion following a deployment that
> increased query complexity. Service was restored by rolling back the deployment
> and increasing the connection pool size.

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Five Whys

1. **Why did the API service fail?**
   - The database connection pool was exhausted

2. **Why was the connection pool exhausted?**
   - The new deployment introduced queries that held connections longer

3. **Why did queries hold connections longer?**
   - A code change added N+1 query pattern (fetching related objects in loop)

4. **Why was this N+1 pattern not caught?**
   - Code review didn't identify performance impact, no load testing

5. **Why didn't load testing catch this?**
   - Load tests don't run automatically in CI/CD, last run 3 months ago

### Root Causes

1. **Immediate Cause**: Database connection pool exhaustion (20 connections insufficient)
2. **Contributing Factors**:
   - N+1 query pattern in new code
   - No automated load testing
   - Connection pool size not reviewed during capacity planning
   - Code review process didn't catch performance issue
3. **Latent Conditions**:
   - Lack of query performance monitoring
   - No connection pool exhaustion alerts
   - Load testing not part of deployment pipeline

---

## What Went Well

Highlight positive aspects to reinforce good practices:

1. ✅ **Fast Detection**: Monitoring alerted within 5 minutes of issue
2. ✅ **Quick Response**: On-call acknowledged in 2 minutes
3. ✅ **Clear Communication**: Regular stakeholder updates maintained
4. ✅ **Effective Rollback**: Deployment rollback completed in 5 minutes
5. ✅ **Good Documentation**: War room timeline enabled easy postmortem writing
6. ✅ **Cross-team Collaboration**: Database team quickly identified root cause

---

## What Went Poorly

Identify areas for improvement without blame:

1. ❌ **Delayed Rollback Decision**: Took 15 minutes to decide on rollback (investigating alternatives)
2. ❌ **Missing Alerts**: No alert for connection pool utilization
3. ❌ **Code Review Gap**: Performance impact not identified in review
4. ❌ **No Load Testing**: Last load test was 3 months old
5. ❌ **Capacity Planning**: Connection pool size not evaluated with deployment
6. ❌ **Monitoring Gap**: No query performance tracking in APM

---

## Action Items

Concrete, actionable improvements with owners and deadlines.

## Lessons Learned

Key takeaways for the organization:

1. **Database connection pools need monitoring and alerting** - We had no visibility until exhaustion
2. **Load testing must be automated** - Manual testing falls out of date quickly
3. **Code review should include performance considerations** - Need checklist and training
4. **Rollback should be the default for new deployments** - Investigate in parallel, but rollback first
5. **Query patterns matter at scale** - N+1 queries work in dev, fail in production

## Metrics and Measurement

### The Four Golden Metrics

**MTTR (Mean Time To Repair)**:
```
Definition: Average time from incident start to resolution
Calculation: Sum(incident_duration) / Count(incidents)
Target: < 1 hour for SEV-1, < 4 hours for SEV-2

Improvements:
- Better runbooks → Faster mitigation
- Automated rollbacks → Faster recovery
- Improved monitoring → Earlier detection
```

**MTTD (Mean Time To Detect)**:
```
Definition: Average time from issue occurrence to detection
Calculation: Time(alert_fired) - Time(issue_started)
Target: < 5 minutes for SEV-1

Improvements:
- Synthetic monitoring → Detect before users
- Better alerting → Higher signal-to-noise
- Real user monitoring → Faster customer impact detection
```

**MTTA (Mean Time To Acknowledge)**:
```
Definition: Average time from alert to acknowledgment
Calculation: Time(acknowledged) - Time(alert_fired)
Target: < 5 minutes for SEV-1, < 15 minutes for SEV-2

Improvements:
- Clear on-call schedules → Right person paged
- Better alert context → Faster assessment
- Reduced alert fatigue → Faster response
```

**MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures)**:
```
Definition: Average time between incidents
Calculation: Time_period / Count(incidents)
Target: Increasing over time (fewer incidents)

Improvements:
- Action item completion → Prevent recurrence
- Chaos engineering → Find issues before production
- Improved testing → Catch bugs earlier
```

### SLO and Error Budget

**Service Level Objectives (SLOs)**:
```yaml
service: api
slo:
  availability: 99.9%  # Max 43.8 minutes downtime/month
  latency_p95: 500ms   # 95% of requests < 500ms
  error_rate: 0.1%     # < 0.1% of requests fail

error_budget:
  monthly_downtime_budget: 43.8 minutes
  monthly_error_budget: 0.1% of requests

current_month:
  downtime_used: 135 minutes  # 308% of budget
  error_budget_used: 0.08%    # 80% of budget

status: ERROR_BUDGET_EXHAUSTED
actions:
  - FREEZE_DEPLOYMENTS
  - FOCUS_ON_RELIABILITY
  - POSTMORTEM_ALL_INCIDENTS
```

**Error Budget Policy**:
```markdown
## Error Budget Policy

### When Error Budget Healthy (< 50% consumed)
- Normal feature development
- Standard deployment frequency
- Normal risk tolerance

### When Error Budget Warning (50-100% consumed)
- Increase focus on reliability
- Require load testing for all deployments
- Reduce deployment frequency
- Prioritize reliability improvements

### When Error Budget Exhausted (> 100%)
- FREEZE all non-critical deployments
- All hands on reliability
- Postmortem all incidents (even SEV-3/4)
- Mandatory chaos engineering
- Weekly reliability review with leadership

### Error Budget Reset
- Monthly on 1st of month
- Quarterly review of SLO targets
```

## On-Call Management

### On-Call Best Practices

**Rotation Structure**:
```
Primary On-Call (24/7)
├─ Takes all initial pages
├─ First responder for incidents
└─ 1 week rotation

Secondary On-Call (24/7)
├─ Backup if primary doesn't respond (15 min)
├─ Escalation for complex issues
└─ 1 week rotation (offset from primary)

Manager On-Call (Business hours + SEV-1)
├─ Decision authority for major changes
├─ Escalation point for cross-team coordination
└─ 1 week rotation
```

**On-Call Handoff**:
```markdown
## On-Call Handoff Template

**From**: Alice (Week of Oct 20-27)
**To**: Bob (Week of Oct 27-Nov 3)

### Incidents This Week
- INCIDENT-123 (SEV-1): Database connection pool exhaustion
  - Status: Resolved
  - Postmortem: Scheduled for Oct 29
  - Action items: In progress

- INCIDENT-124 (SEV-3): Elevated latency in search
  - Status: Monitoring
  - Root cause: Unknown
  - May recur - watch dashboards

### Ongoing Issues
- Redis cluster showing occasional slow responses
  - Not alert-worthy yet
  - Dashboard: https://grafana.../redis
  - May need investigation if worsens

### Scheduled Maintenance
- Database maintenance window: Oct 30, 02:00-04:00 UTC
  - Plan: Minor version upgrade
  - Runbook: https://docs.../db-upgrade
  - No user impact expected

### Known Quirks
- Payment service sometimes throws false alerts at 3am
  - Known issue, vendor investigating
  - Safe to ack if metrics look normal

### Important Contacts
- Database: @diana (vendor support: +1-555-0123)
- Networking: @evan
- Security: @frank (critical issues only)

### Tips
- Check #deployment-notifications before investigating
- Recent deployment? Always consider rollback first
- Database team very responsive, don't hesitate to page
```

**On-Call Health**:
```
Metrics to Monitor:
├─ Page frequency (target: < 5 per week)
├─ After-hours pages (target: < 2 per week)
├─ False positive rate (target: < 10%)
├─ Handoff quality (survey after each rotation)
└─ Burnout indicators (long incidents, weekend work)

Improvements:
├─ Reduce false positives → Alert tuning
├─ Reduce after-hours pages → Fix chronic issues
├─ Improve runbooks → Faster resolution
└─ Increase team size → Less frequent rotations
```

### On-Call Compensation and Wellness

**Compensation Models**:
1. **Fixed Stipend**: $X per day on-call
2. **Incident-Based**: $Y per incident handled
3. **Time-Based**: 1.5x hourly rate for off-hours work
4. **Comp Time**: Time off equal to incident duration

**Wellness Practices**:
```
Before Rotation:
- [ ] Review recent incidents
- [ ] Test paging device
- [ ] Sync with previous on-call
- [ ] Review runbooks for common issues
- [ ] Clear calendar for potential incidents

During Rotation:
- [ ] Limit alcohol consumption
- [ ] Stay near computer/internet
- [ ] Keep phone charged and volume on
- [ ] Minimize travel
- [ ] Adjust sleep schedule if needed

After Rotation:
- [ ] Hand off cleanly to next on-call
- [ ] Document any new issues
- [ ] Update runbooks as needed
- [ ] Take recovery time if needed
```

## Escalation Policies

### Escalation Ladder

```yaml
escalation_policy:
  name: "API Service"

  level_1:
    targets: [primary_on_call]
    timeout: 5 minutes
    notification: [sms, phone_call, push]

  level_2:
    targets: [secondary_on_call]
    timeout: 10 minutes
    notification: [sms, phone_call]

  level_3:
    targets: [engineering_manager]
    timeout: 15 minutes
    notification: [phone_call]

  level_4:
    targets: [director_engineering, vp_engineering]
    notification: [phone_call]
```

**Escalation Decision Tree**:
```
Incident Occurs
  ↓
Primary responds? NO → Wait 5 min → Page Secondary
                  YES ↓
Can Primary handle? YES → Resolve
                    NO ↓
Need specialist? YES → Page team SME
                 NO ↓
Need manager decision? YES → Page Manager
                       NO ↓
Cross-team coordination? YES → Page Other Team Lead
                         NO ↓
Customer data at risk? YES → Page Security Team
                       NO ↓
Continue investigation
```

## SRE Practices

### Chaos Engineering

**Purpose**: Proactively find weaknesses before they cause incidents

**Chaos Experiments**:
```yaml
# Experiment 1: Database failover
experiment:
  name: "Database Failover"
  hypothesis: "System handles database failover gracefully"
  blast_radius: "Staging environment"

  steps:
    - baseline: Measure error rate, latency
    - action: Failover primary database to replica
    - observe: Monitor metrics for 10 minutes
    - rollback: Failover back if issues

  success_criteria:
    - Error rate < 1%
    - P95 latency < 2x baseline
    - No customer impact

  results:
    - Error rate spiked to 15% for 30 seconds
    - Connection pool didn't handle failover
    - Action item: Improve connection retry logic

# Experiment 2: High CPU load
experiment:
  name: "API Service CPU Exhaustion"
  hypothesis: "Service handles CPU spike gracefully"

  steps:
    - baseline: Normal CPU usage (~30%)
    - action: Inject CPU load (stress test)
    - observe: Monitor autoscaling, error rates

  success_criteria:
    - Autoscaler triggers within 2 minutes
    - Error rate < 5%
    - No cascading failures
```

**Chaos Tools**:
- **Chaos Monkey**: Random instance termination
- **Litmus Chaos**: Kubernetes chaos engineering
- **Toxiproxy**: Network failure simulation
- **Gremlin**: Comprehensive chaos platform

### Incident Review Culture

**Review Cadence**:
```
Weekly: Review all incidents from past week
├─ SEV-1/SEV-2: Full postmortem
├─ SEV-3: Brief review, lessons learned
└─ SEV-4: Track patterns, batch review

Monthly: Metrics and trends
├─ MTTR, MTTD, MTTA trends
├─ Incident count by service
├─ Action item completion rate
└─ SLO/error budget status

Quarterly: Deep dive and planning
├─ Systemic issues across incidents
├─ Process improvements
├─ Tool and automation investments
└─ Team capacity and rotation health
```

**Blameless Culture Reinforcement**:
```
DO in Reviews:
✅ "The deployment process allowed this"
✅ "The monitoring didn't alert us early enough"
✅ "The documentation was outdated"
✅ "We learned that..."

DON'T in Reviews:
❌ "Alice made a mistake"
❌ "Bob should have caught this"
❌ "Why didn't Charlie test better?"
❌ Focusing on individual actions

Focus: What can we learn? How can we improve the SYSTEM?
```

### Continuous Improvement

**Action Item Tracking**:
```python
# Track postmortem action items
action_items = [
    {
        'id': 'AI-123',
        'incident': 'INC-456',
        'description': 'Add connection pool monitoring',
        'owner': 'bob',
        'deadline': '2025-11-03',
        'status': 'in_progress',
        'priority': 'high'
    },
    # ...
]

# Monthly review
completed = [ai for ai in action_items if ai['status'] == 'completed']
overdue = [ai for ai in action_items
           if ai['status'] != 'completed' and
           datetime.now() > ai['deadline']]

completion_rate = len(completed) / len(action_items) * 100

print(f"Action Item Completion Rate: {completion_rate:.1f}%")
print(f"Overdue Items: {len(overdue)}")
```

**Reliability Investments**:
1. **Monitoring**: Better detection, reduce MTTD
2. **Automation**: Automated mitigation, reduce MTTR
3. **Testing**: Catch issues before production
4. **Documentation**: Better runbooks, faster response
5. **Architecture**: Resilient design, reduce incident frequency

## Summary

Effective incident response requires:

1. **Clear Processes**: Well-defined lifecycle, roles, escalation
2. **Strong Communication**: Stakeholder updates, war room coordination
3. **Fast Detection**: Monitoring, alerting, synthetic checks
4. **Quick Mitigation**: Runbooks, rollbacks, scaling
5. **Continuous Learning**: Blameless postmortems, action items, metrics
6. **Cultural Support**: Blameless culture, on-call wellness, reliability focus

**Key Success Factors**:
- Practice incident response (fire drills, chaos engineering)
- Maintain runbooks and keep them updated
- Invest in monitoring and alerting
- Foster blameless culture
- Track and complete action items
- Measure and improve metrics (MTTR, MTTD, MTTA)
- Take care of on-call engineers

**Remember**: Every incident is an opportunity to improve. The goal is not zero incidents (impossible), but rather:
1. Minimize customer impact
2. Respond quickly and effectively
3. Learn and improve
4. Build resilience over time
