# HSM Disaster Recovery Runbook

## Contact Information
- HSM Administrator: admin@example.com
- Security Team: security@example.com
- Vendor Support: support@vendor.com

## Recovery Time Objectives (RTO)
- Critical Services: 4 hours
- Standard Services: 24 hours

## Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)
- Critical Keys: 1 hour (hourly backups)
- Standard Keys: 24 hours (daily backups)

## Scenario 1: Single HSM Failure (HA Deployed)
1. Verify automatic failover to secondary HSM
2. Alert HSM administrator
3. Order replacement HSM
4. Configure and add to HA group
5. Verify synchronization

## Scenario 2: Complete HSM Loss (No HA)
1. Declare disaster
2. Provision new HSM hardware
3. Initialize HSM
4. Retrieve latest backup from secure storage
5. Verify backup integrity (checksum)
6. Decrypt backup
7. Restore keys to new HSM
8. Test key operations
9. Update client configurations
10. Resume operations
11. Monitor for issues

## Scenario 3: Key Corruption
1. Identify affected keys
2. Disable affected keys in applications
3. Restore from backup (selective restore if supported)
4. Generate new keys if restoration fails
5. Update certificates/references
6. Re-enable applications

## Scenario 4: Site Disaster
1. Activate DR site
2. Provision HSM at DR location
3. Restore from offsite backup
4. Redirect traffic to DR site
5. Verify operations
6. Plan return to primary site

## Backup Schedule
- Hourly: Critical keys
- Daily: All keys
- Weekly: Full system backup
- Monthly: Offsite backup to geographically distant location

## Testing Schedule
- Monthly: Backup integrity verification
- Quarterly: DR procedure drill (non-production)
- Annually: Full DR site activation test

## Verification Checklist
After recovery:
- [ ] All keys accessible
- [ ] Key operations functional (sign, encrypt, decrypt)
- [ ] Application connectivity restored
- [ ] Audit logs intact
- [ ] Compliance requirements met
- [ ] Performance acceptable
- [ ] Monitoring active

## Rollback Plan
If recovery fails:
1. Document failure reason
2. Attempt alternate backup
3. Contact vendor support
4. Generate new keys if necessary
5. Update certificates
6. Communicate to stakeholders
