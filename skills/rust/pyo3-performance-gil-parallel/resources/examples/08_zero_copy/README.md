# Example 08: Zero-Copy Data Transfer

Demonstrates techniques for minimizing data copying when processing large arrays.

## Concepts

- **In-place processing**: Modify data without copying
- **Reference-based operations**: Work with borrowed data
- **Chunked processing**: Cache-efficient operations
- **Minimal allocation**: Reduce memory pressure

## Building

```bash
pip install maturin && maturin develop --release && python test_example.py
```

## Performance Benefits

Zero-copy approaches can be 2-10x faster for large arrays by avoiding memory allocation and copying overhead.

## Next Steps
