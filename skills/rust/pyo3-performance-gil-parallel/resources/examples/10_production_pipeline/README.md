# Example 10: Production Data Processing Pipeline

A complete, production-ready parallel data processing pipeline demonstrating all the techniques from previous examples combined into a real-world system.

## Features

- **Multi-stage Processing**: Validation, filtering, transformation, post-validation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of NaN, infinity, and invalid data
- **Performance Monitoring**: Detailed statistics on processing, filtering, and failures
- **Batched Processing**: Configurable batch sizes for optimal performance
- **Lock-free Counting**: Atomic counters for statistics without locks
- **Scalable**: Configurable thread count for different workloads

## Architecture

```
Input Data
    ↓
Stage 1: Validation (filter NaN/Inf)
    ↓
Stage 2: Business Logic Filter (negative values)
    ↓
Stage 3: Transform (sqrt * 2)
    ↓
Stage 4: Post-validation
    ↓
Output + Statistics
```

## Usage

```python
pipeline = production_pipeline.DataPipeline(
    thread_count=8,
    batch_size=10000
)

results, stats = pipeline.process(data)
print(f"Processed {stats.items_processed} items in {stats.duration_secs}s")
print(f"Throughput: {stats.items_processed / stats.duration_secs} items/sec")
```

## Building and Testing

```bash
pip install maturin
maturin develop --release
python test_example.py
```

## Performance Characteristics

On typical hardware (8-core CPU):
- **Throughput**: 10-50M items/second depending on complexity
- **Latency**: Sub-microsecond per item
- **Scalability**: Near-linear scaling up to core count
- **Memory**: Minimal overhead, O(1) working memory

## Production Considerations

### Thread Count
- Start with CPU core count
- Monitor CPU utilization
- Adjust based on workload characteristics

### Batch Size
- Larger batches: Better cache locality, less overhead
- Smaller batches: Better load balancing
- Typical: 1000-10000 items per batch

### Error Handling
- Validate inputs to prevent panics
- Track error rates in statistics
- Log or alert on high error rates

### Monitoring
- Track throughput (items/sec)
- Monitor error rates
- Watch for performance degradation

## Key Techniques Used

1. **Rayon Parallel Iterators**: Automatic work distribution
2. **Atomic Counters**: Lock-free statistics
3. **GIL Release**: Python threads can run during processing
4. **Filter-map Chain**: Efficient multi-stage pipeline
5. **Batched Processing**: Better cache utilization
6. **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of invalid data

## Comparison to Pure Python

Typical speedups:
- **10-50x** faster than equivalent Python code
- **Near-linear** scaling with cores
- **Lower memory** usage than Python
- **Predictable** performance characteristics

## Next Steps

Apply these patterns to your own data processing needs:
- Customize validation logic
- Add domain-specific transformations
- Integrate with your data sources
- Monitor and tune for your workload
