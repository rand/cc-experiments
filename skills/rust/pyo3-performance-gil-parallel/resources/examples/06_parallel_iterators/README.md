# Example 06: Advanced Parallel Iterator Patterns

This example demonstrates advanced Rayon parallel iterator patterns including map, filter, fold, partition, and more complex operations.

## Concepts Covered

- **Parallel Map/Filter/Reduce**: Classic functional operations
- **Flat Map**: Flattening nested structures
- **Fold/Reduce**: Custom aggregations
- **Partition**: Splitting into groups
- **Predicates**: any(), all(), find()
- **Chaining**: Composing multiple operations

## Key Functions

All functions demonstrate parallel iterator patterns that automatically distribute work across cores.

## Building and Testing

```bash
pip install maturin
maturin develop --release
python test_example.py
```

## Learning Points

1. Rayon provides rich iterator API
2. Automatic load balancing
3. Composable operations
4. Type-safe transformations

## Next Steps

- Example 07: Multi-threaded communication with channels
- Example 08: Zero-copy data transfer with numpy
