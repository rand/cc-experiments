# Skills Catalog

**Total Skills**: 293 across 31 categories
**Gateway Skills**: 28 (auto-discovered by Claude Code)
**Agent Skills**: 3 (elegant-design, anti-slop, typed-holes-refactor)

## Overview

This skills library uses a **progressive discovery architecture** optimized for context efficiency:

1. **Gateway Skills** (`discover-{category}/SKILL.md`) - Auto-discovered by Claude Code based on keywords
2. **Category Indexes** (`{category}/INDEX.md`) - Detailed category overviews loaded on-demand
3. **Individual Skills** (`{category}/{skill}.md`) - Specific skill content loaded as needed

**Context Savings**: 60-84% reduction vs monolithic index (5-10K tokens vs 25K+)

## How It Works

### Automatic Discovery
When you work on a task, Claude Code automatically activates relevant gateway skills based on keywords in your request.

**Example**: "Design a REST API with Postgres"
- → `discover-api` gateway activates (keywords: API, REST)
- → `discover-database` gateway activates (keywords: Postgres, database)
- → Both gateways load (~4K tokens total)
- → You can then load specific skills as needed

### Manual Discovery
Browse categories and load skills explicitly:

```bash
# List all gateway skills
ls -d skills/discover-*

# Load a category overview
cat skills/api/INDEX.md

# Load a specific skill
cat skills/api/rest-api-design.md
```

### Search by Keyword
```bash
# Find skills matching a keyword
grep -r "keyword" skills/*/INDEX.md

# Find gateway skills by description
grep "description:" skills/discover-*/SKILL.md
```
