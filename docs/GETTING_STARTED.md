# Getting Started with cc-polymath

## What is cc-polymath?

cc-polymath is a Claude Code plugin that provides **400 production-ready skills** across 31+ domains, organized through an intelligent three-tier discovery system. Instead of loading thousands of lines of documentation upfront, skills auto-discover based on your work and activate only when needed.

**The Problem**: Traditional approaches force you to either load everything (overwhelming context) or remember what exists (cognitive overhead).

**The Solution**: Skills automatically activate when you mention relevant keywords like "React", "PostgreSQL", or "REST API". You can also use explicit commands like `/discover-frontend` for manual control. This hybrid approach gives you both convenience and control while using 98% less context than loading all skills upfront.

## Installation (30 seconds)

Open Claude Code and install the plugin:

```
/plugin marketplace add rand/cc-polymath
/plugin install cc-polymath@cc-polymath
```

Wait for the confirmation message:
```
✓ Plugin cc-polymath installed successfully
```

That's it! Skills are now available and will auto-discover as you work.

## Verification (10 seconds)

Verify your installation is working correctly:

```bash
bash <cc-polymath-root>/scripts/verify-install.sh

## Your First 5 Minutes

Let's get you productive immediately with a guided walkthrough.

### Minute 1: Discover What's Available

Check which skills are recommended for your current project:

```
/skills
```

You'll see personalized recommendations based on the files in your directory. For example, if you have a `package.json`, you'll see frontend skills recommended.

**Example output**:
```
RECOMMENDED FOR THIS PROJECT:
→ discover-frontend
  Read <cc-polymath-root>/skills/discover-frontend/SKILL.md

→ discover-testing
  Read <cc-polymath-root>/skills/discover-testing/SKILL.md

CATEGORIES (400 skills):
Frontend (10) | Database (11) | API (7) | Testing (6) | Diagrams (8) | ML (33)
[...]
```

### Minute 2: Try a Gateway Skill

Load a gateway skill manually to see how it works:

```
/discover-frontend
```

This loads the frontend gateway skill, giving you quick access to React, Next.js, TypeScript, and more. Gateway skills are lightweight (~200 lines) and provide overview + quick reference.

**What you get**:
- Quick reference for common patterns
- Links to specific skills
- Auto-context for follow-up questions

### Minute 3: Browse a Category

Explore all skills in a specific category:

```
/skills database
```

You'll see a detailed breakdown of all 11 database skills with descriptions:
```
DATABASE SKILLS (11 total)
Keywords: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, query optimization

SKILLS:
1. database-selection - Choose the right database for your use case
2. postgres-query-optimization - EXPLAIN plans, indexes, performance
3. postgres-schema-design - Designing schemas, relationships, data types
4. mongodb-patterns - Document modeling, aggregation pipelines
5. redis-patterns - Caching strategies, data structures
[...]
```

### Minute 4: Test Auto-Discovery

Here's where the magic happens. Just start working naturally:

**Try this**: "I need to build a REST API for user authentication"

**What happens**:
1. The `discover-api` skill auto-discovers based on keywords "REST API"
2. Claude loads relevant API design patterns
3. Follow-up questions get context-aware answers about authentication

**You didn't need to**:
- Remember the skill exists
- Type a command to load it
- Search through documentation

Skills just appear when you need them.

### Minute 5: Create a Diagram

Let's make something visual:

**Ask**: "Create a flowchart showing a typical login flow"

**What happens**:
1. `discover-diagrams` skill auto-discovers
2. Claude creates a Mermaid flowchart
3. You get a visual diagram in your conversation

**Result**: Professional flowchart in seconds, ready to add to your README.

## Quick Command Reference

| Command | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `/plugin list` | Show installed plugins | Check cc-polymath version |
| `/skills` | Project recommendations | See skills relevant to current directory |
| `/skills [category]` | Browse category | `/skills frontend` or `/skills database` |
| `/skills [search]` | Search for skills | `/skills postgres` or `/skills react` |

**Pro tip**: Most of the time you won't need commands! Skills auto-discover based on what you're working on. Use commands when you want explicit control or want to browse.

## How Skills Work

### Two Ways to Access Skills

**1. Auto-Discovery (Recommended)**

Skills automatically activate based on what you're working on:

- Mention "React" → `discover-frontend` skill activates
- Mention "PostgreSQL" → `discover-database` skill activates
- Mention "REST API" → `discover-api` skill activates

**No commands needed.** Just work naturally and skills appear when relevant.

**2. Manual Commands (When You Want Control)**

Use slash commands for explicit control:

- `/discover-frontend` → Manually load frontend skills
- `/skills database` → Browse all database skills
- `/skills postgres` → Search for PostgreSQL-specific skills

**Best for**: Browsing, exploring, or when auto-discovery doesn't trigger.

### Three-Tier Progressive Loading

cc-polymath uses a smart three-tier system to minimize context usage:

**Tier 1: Gateway Skills** (~200 lines each)
- Lightweight entry points
- Auto-discover based on keywords
- Provide quick reference + links
- Example: `discover-frontend` gives you React, Next.js overview

**Tier 2: Category Indexes** (~500 lines each)
- Comprehensive skill listings
- Loaded when browsing or planning
- Show all skills in a domain
- Example: `frontend/INDEX.md` lists all 10 frontend skills

**Tier 3: Individual Skills** (~320 lines average)
- Complete implementation guides
- Loaded on-demand when specifically needed
- Deep technical content
- Example: `rest-api-design.md` has full REST patterns

**Result**: Loading 3-5 gateway skills uses ~2-5K tokens vs 143K tokens if you loaded all 400 skills upfront. That's **98% context savings**.

### Under the Hood

**Skills are "model-invoked"**:
- Claude intelligently decides when to use them based on conversation context
- The skill's `description` field contains keywords that trigger activation
- No manual file loading needed (though commands can do it explicitly)

**Commands execute bash**:
- Slash commands like `/discover-frontend` run bash commands
- They execute `Read <cc-polymath-root>/skills/discover-frontend/SKILL.md`
- Output loads into Claude's context
- Both auto-discovery and commands work together seamlessly

## Understanding the Hybrid Approach

You might wonder: "If skills auto-discover, why have commands?"

**Both approaches serve different needs**:

**Auto-Discovery**:
- ✓ Seamless, zero overhead
- ✓ Skills appear when relevant
- ✓ No need to remember what exists
- ⚠ Might not trigger for edge cases

**Manual Commands**:
- ✓ Explicit control
- ✓ Browsing and exploration
- ✓ Guaranteed to load what you want
- ⚠ Requires knowing what to load

**The Best Workflow**:
1. Start working naturally (let auto-discovery help)
2. Use `/skills [search]` when you want something specific
3. Use `/discover-*` when you want to browse a domain
4. Skills compose naturally regardless of how they're loaded
