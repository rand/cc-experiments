   - Added explicit exception logging to parsing operations

2. **debugging-production**:
   - Added safety check: temp directory cleanup restricted to /tmp/*

3. **log-aggregation**:
   - Clarified logging-only functions vs database operations
   - Added explicit comments distinguishing query logging from execution

4. **dependency-management**:
   - Added safety warnings to destructive npm operations
   - Documented safer alternatives (download-inspect-execute for curl|bash)

### Production Readiness
- ✅ **Type Hints**: All Python scripts have comprehensive type hints
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Try/except blocks with logging throughout
- ✅ **Logging**: Structured logging with log levels in all scripts

## Key Achievements

### 1. Strategic Focus 100% Complete
✅ **All three Strategic Focus categories at 100%**:
- Cryptography: 7/7 (100%)
- Protocols: 8/8 (100%)
- Engineering: 14/14 (100%)

This is the **first major milestone** for the cc-polymath skills library, establishing comprehensive coverage across security, networking, and software engineering practices.

### 2. Production-Ready Observability Stack
Wave 11 completes an end-to-end observability and debugging toolkit:
- **Profiling**: performance-profiling (CPU, memory, I/O)
- **Tracing**: debugging-production (distributed tracing, APM)
- **Logging**: log-aggregation (ELK, EFK, Loki)
- **Errors**: error-tracking (Sentry, error budgets)

### 3. Enhanced Quality Standards
All Wave 11 skills follow enhanced standards from Wave 10:
- Comprehensive security scanning
- Operational safety validation
- Production readiness checks
- Type hints and structured logging throughout

### 4. Multi-Language Support
Wave 11 skills support multiple programming languages:
- **Python**: All skills have Python implementations
- **Node.js/JavaScript**: log-aggregation, error-tracking, dependency-management
- **Go**: error-tracking, debugging-production
- **Shell/Bash**: debugging-production, tcp-optimization, dependency-management
- **Multi-language tooling**: Profiling across Python, Go, Node.js, Java

## Challenges Solved

### 1. Security Audit False Positives
**Challenge**: Security scanner flagged standard operations as dangerous:
- `rm -rf` in temp directory cleanup
- `curl | bash` in documentation examples
- Query string manipulation in logging functions

**Solution**:
- Added explicit safety checks (`if [[ "$TEMP_DIR" == /tmp/* ]]`)
- Documented safer alternatives in examples
- Clarified logging-only vs execution contexts
- Accepted remaining findings as documented best practices

### 2. Safety Validator Overfitting
**Challenge**: Safety validator flagged entire parsing blocks for single `except ValueError: continue`

**Solution**:
- Added explicit exception logging with context
- Maintained parsing performance while improving observability
- Identified and documented validator bugs for future fixes

### 3. Multi-Platform Log Aggregation
**Challenge**: Supporting ELK, EFK, and Loki with different architectures

**Solution**:
- Created unified setup_logging_stack.py supporting all three
- Provided platform-specific configuration examples
- Documented migration paths between platforms
- Included cost optimization strategies for each

### 4. Error Budget Integration
**Challenge**: Connecting error tracking to SLO/error budget systems

**Solution**:
- Implemented analyze_errors.py with SLO tracking
- Created error budget calculation algorithms
- Provided Prometheus/Grafana integration examples
- Documented error budget policies and thresholds
