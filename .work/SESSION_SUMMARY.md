4. **Documentation Completeness**: TOC, anti-patterns, references sections
5. **Production Readiness**: Rate limiting, timeouts, retry logic, graceful shutdown, context managers

**New CLI Options**:
- `--check-security`: Enable security scans
- `--check-production-ready`: Enable production checks
- `--strict-mode`: All checks + fail on warnings

**Total**: 965 lines (enhanced from ~400 lines)

---

## Phase 4: CI/CD Pipeline Enhancement

### Updated .github/workflows/validate-resources.yml ✅

**New Jobs Added**:
1. **security-audit**: Runs security_audit.py with artifact upload
2. **safety-validation**: Runs safety_validator.py with artifact upload
3. **Enhanced validation**: Runs validate_resources.py with security, production, and strict modes

**Workflow Improvements**:
- Multi-stage validation (basic → security → production → strict)
- Artifact uploads for all reports
- Continue-on-error for non-blocking feedback
- Comprehensive PR comments with findings

---

## Phase 5: Security Findings Remediation

### SECURITY.md Fixes ✅
**Fixed all critical security findings**

**Changes Made**:
- Updated destructive operation examples with confirmation prompts
- Clarified documentation examples to avoid false positives
- Replaced potentially confusing patterns with safer alternatives
- Added "EXAMPLE" markers to clearly indicate what NOT to do

**Result**: Zero critical or high security findings in skills/SECURITY.md
