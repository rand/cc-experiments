## Next Session Checklist

**When resuming Wave 12**:

1. **Review Context**
   - [ ] Read `.work/WAVE12_PENDING_WORK.md` - Complete roadmap
   - [ ] Review `.work/WAVE12_PHASE1_BASELINE.md` - Quality context
   - [ ] Check git log to confirm on commit `cf8fa5d`

2. **Verify State**
   - [ ] Confirm 58 skills have Level 3 Resources
   - [ ] Run `git status` (should be clean)
   - [ ] Check `.work/` directory for tracking files

3. **Start Phase 2**
   - [ ] Create todo list from Phase 2 tasks (8 skills)
   - [ ] Decide: parallel agents or sequential execution
   - [ ] Begin with `api-versioning` skill
   - [ ] Apply enhanced quality gates from Wave 10-11

4. **Quality Gates** (per skill)
   - [ ] REFERENCE.md: 2,500-4,000 lines
   - [ ] Scripts: 3 scripts, 700+ lines each
   - [ ] Examples: 7-9 production-ready
   - [ ] Security audit: 0 HIGH/CRITICAL
   - [ ] Type hints: 100% Python
   - [ ] CLI: --help, --json, --verbose, --dry-run

## Metrics to Track

### Wave 12 Targets
| Metric | Start | Target | Current |
|--------|-------|--------|---------|
| Skills with Resources | 58 | 78 | 58 |
| API Category | 50% | 100% | 50% |
| Cryptography Category | 64% | 100% | 64% |
| Database Category | 31% | 62% | 31% |
| Frontend Category | 27% | 64% | 27% |

### Quality Targets (New Skills Only)
- CRITICAL findings: 0 (in new skills)
- HIGH findings: 0 (in new skills)
- Production readiness: 100%
- Type hints coverage: 100% (Python)

## Success Criteria (Wave 12 Complete)

**When all phases done**:
- ✅ 78 skills with Level 3 Resources (20% of library)
- ✅ 4 categories at 100% (Protocols, API, Cryptography, Engineering Strategic)
- ✅ ~100,000 lines of production code added
- ✅ 0 HIGH/CRITICAL in all new skills
- ✅ Comprehensive quality dashboard
- ✅ Clear roadmap for Wave 13

---

## Notes

**Why Pause After Phase 1?**
- Quality baseline established (98 findings documented)
- Security scanner enhanced (false positives fixed)
- Clear roadmap created for remaining work (20 skills)
- Natural breakpoint before major skill development effort

**Why Focus on New Skills vs Backfill?**
- New skills (Waves 10-11) have 0 findings when built to enhanced standards
- 60% of existing findings are documentation examples (warnings needed, not code changes)
- Delivering 20 new production-quality skills provides more value than fixing 48 legacy skills
- Backfill can be systematic post-Wave 12 quality sprint

**Execution Strategy for Phase 2+**:
- Parallel execution where possible (2-4 skills simultaneously)
- Strict quality gates per skill (no compromise)
- Pause after Phase 2 to assess progress
- Flexible timeline (quality over speed)
